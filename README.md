# Fuzzing Script

This Go script performs fuzzing on a target URL by trying different characters from a wordlist or charset. It constructs modified URLs with specific patterns and checks if the response contains a specific string (e.g., "technician").

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

- [Go](https://golang.org/) installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

#clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/LucasOneZ/HTB-technician-brute.git

cd HTB-technician-brute

go init lucas

go build

#Run the script!

./lucas


or instead go install github.com/LucasOneZ/HTB-technician-brute/lucas@latest

```
